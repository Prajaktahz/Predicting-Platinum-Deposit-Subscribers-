# üìä Analysis and Model Development for Targeted Marketing of N/LAB Platinum Deposit in the Banking Sector

## Project Overview
The **N/LAB Platinum Deposit** project aims to effectively market a new financial product in the banking sector. Utilizing historical data from a similar product, we have developed predictive models to identify potential customers who are likely to subscribe to the **N/LAB Platinum Deposit**. By employing machine learning techniques, our objective is to minimize marketing costs while maximizing engagement with interested customers.

## üîç Methodology
### Data Collection and Preparation
- **Historical Data**: We utilized historical data from a comparable financial product, which includes various customer features and their previous engagement with banking products.
- **Feature Engineering**: Important features were identified through exploratory data analysis, including customer demographics, engagement duration, previous subscription outcomes, and contact methods.

### Model Development
Three different classification models were developed to predict customer interest:
1. **Na√Øve Bayes Classifier**: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem.
2. **Decision Tree Classifier**: A non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression.
3. **Random Forest Classifier**: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and avoid overfitting.

### Model Evaluation
- **Performance Metrics**: Models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Best Model Selection**: The **Random Forest** classifier emerged as the most effective model for predicting potential subscribers.

## üìà Results
The analysis demonstrated the following key findings:
- Customer engagement duration significantly correlates with subscription likelihood.
- Customers contacted via cellphone have a higher probability of subscription.
- Previous subscriptions to similar products are indicative of future interest.
- Target age group for potential subscribers lies between 30 and 50 years old.
- Married customers tend to have higher balances and a greater likelihood of subscription.

## üí° Business Recommendations
Based on the model findings, we recommend the following strategies for targeted marketing of the N/LAB Platinum Deposit:

1. **Focus on Customer Engagement Duration**:
   - Extend customer engagement during phone calls to emphasize the product's benefits.

2. **Use Cellphone Contact Method**:
   - Prioritize cellphone communication for marketing outreach to increase subscription likelihood.

3. **Target Previous Subscribers**:
   - Focus on customers with prior subscriptions to similar products for a higher conversion rate.

4. **Target the Correct Age Group**:
   - Aim marketing efforts at customers aged between 30 and 50, as they show the highest subscription interest.

5. **Target Married Customers**:
   - Prioritize married individuals, who generally possess higher balances and a greater propensity to subscribe.
